# MJML CMS
> Extended version of the MJML editor with support for dynamic templating. 

Forked from [mjml-cms](https://github.com/Idnan/mjml-cms)

## Improvements

- Changed `react-script` Webpack-based packaging to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Stand-alone webapp (doesn't need an API)
- Templating is done with [dot](https://olado.github.io/doT/index.html) instead of Handlebars
- Updated dependencies

## TODO

- Migrate CodeMirror 5 to 6
- Handle more templating lib
- Display MJML / templating errors to user
